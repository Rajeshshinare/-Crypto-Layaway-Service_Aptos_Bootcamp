Crypto Layaway Service
Description
The Crypto Layaway Service is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to lock in today's cryptocurrency prices for future purchases through periodic payment plans. This innovative financial service allows customers to secure items at current market prices while paying over time, protecting them from price volatility in the crypto market.

The smart contract facilitates a trustless layaway system where buyers can create payment plans with locked-in prices and make scheduled payments to merchants. This eliminates the need for traditional financial intermediaries while providing price protection and flexible payment options.

Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the way people make purchases in the volatile cryptocurrency ecosystem by providing:

Price Stability: Protection against crypto market volatility by locking in current prices
Financial Accessibility: Making expensive items affordable through installment payments
Decentralized Commerce: Enabling trustless transactions without intermediaries
Global Reach: Providing layaway services to anyone with access to the Aptos blockchain
Transparent Payments: All transactions and payment schedules are recorded on-chain for full transparency
We aim to bridge the gap between traditional layaway services and modern decentralized finance (DeFi), creating a more inclusive and stable purchasing experience in the crypto space.
